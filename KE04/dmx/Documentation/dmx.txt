Module "UART"      (component AsynchroSerial)
   - UART_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - UART_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - UART_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - UART_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - UART_GetBreak -Tests the internal input break flag, returns it (whether the break has occurred or not) and clears it. This 
                method is available only if the property <Break signal> and the property receiver are enabled.

Module "RED"       (component PWM)
   - RED_SetRatio8 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer capabilities and on the 
                selected period.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU1_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU1_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_SelectOutputAction -Sets the type of compare match and counter overflow action on channel output. This method is 
                available when at least one channel is configured.

Module "GREEN"     (component PWM)
   - GREEN_SetRatio8 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer capabilities and on the 
                selected period.

Module "BLUE"      (component PWM)
   - BLUE_SetRatio8 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer capabilities and on the 
                selected period.

Module "BreakReceived" (component BitIO)
   - BreakReceived_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property 
                for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - BreakReceived_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - BreakReceived_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - BreakReceived_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "ByteReceived" (component BitIO)
   - ByteReceived_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property 
                for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - ByteReceived_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - ByteReceived_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - ByteReceived_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "BufferFull" (component BitIO)
   - BufferFull_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - BufferFull_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - BufferFull_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - BufferFull_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKE04Z8WJ4)
   - Cpu_SetOperationMode -This method requests to change the component's operation mode (RUN, WAIT, SLEEP, STOP). The target 
                operation mode will be entered immediately.   See <Operation mode settings> for further details of the 
                operation modes mapping to low power modes of the cpu.
